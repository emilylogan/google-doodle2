# Wall-E Google Doodle

I chose to make my Google Doodle about Wall-E because I really like the movie. Also, Wall-E's 11-year anniversary is coming up on the 27th of June so why not create a doodle to celebrate Wall-E's birthday. 

Wall-E is a Pixar fantasy/sci-fi kidsâ€™ film about what happens to the Earth after centuries of pollution. Wall-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is responsible for cleaning up the Earth for the humans so they can return home. However, Wall-E has been been on Earth for over seven centuries and there is still tons of garbage. 

For the doodle I would like to have Wall-E and his girlfriend Eve flying around in space :D.
